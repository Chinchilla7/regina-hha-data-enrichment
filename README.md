data-enrichment
This repo aims to enrich data from sparcs with public health information from the Neighborhood Atlas based on zip code.
The data can be downloaded from https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8 
and  https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/.
Please note that the csv files will be too large to be pushed onto github so it is adviced that the data be put in the gitignore file.
The newly merged data will be put in a csv file in the folder "enriched"
